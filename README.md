# Dynamic Empire & Role-Playing (Alpha Release)
This is a gameplay mod for Total War: Warhammer 3, built specifically for ~~Reikland~~Karl Franz (Empire) campaigns in Immortal Empires.

As the name suggests, Dynamic Empire & Role-Playing (DERP) aims to flesh out two aspects of Karl Franz Empire campagins:
- Dynamic Empire
    - Inject more variety and dynamicism to the campaign through missions, dilemmas, and interactions with Elector Counts and other races in Warhammer.
- Role-Playing
    - Introduce favourite elements of Role-Playing Games, such as having decisions that matter. The choices the player makes when interacting with the new missions and dilemmas introduced by this mod will have consequences that will give each campaign a unique feel.

Some likely outcomes if this mod achieves its vision:
- The player will spend most of their time with the Empire regions of the Old World, where there will be many things for them to do to keep things fresh and exciting
- Protecting the Empire will feel like XCOM, where the player's attention will be divided across the different regions of the Empire and will have to make sacrifices
- More interactions with Elector Counts
- More interactions with other factions
- Reward players for having other Empire mods by building off their content/mechanics

## Planned Features
The following is a non-exhaustive list of currently planned features:

- [Dynamic Starts](#Dynamic-Starts) (active development - working prototype completed)
- [Imperial Mandate](#Imperial-Mandate) (active development - working prototype completed)

- [Imperial Camp](#Imperial-Camp) (not started - extremely low priority)

### Elector Counts Fealty Randomiser
Randomises the fealty of all Elector Counts at the start of a new campaign for a fresh start each time.

This has been released as a [standalone mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981189943).

### Dynamic Starts
Create new starts for Karl Franz as randomised alternatives to the Vanilla start of putting down the Empire Secessionists.

A working prototype is currently being actively developed and improved upon - Karl Franz randomly starts in any province controlled by an Elector Count and is at war with invading Ogres.

The next planned start is a tweaked Vanilla experience fighting Empire Secessionists, and an invasion of Daemons of Chaos.

Priority will be given to factions that typically have little interaction with the Empire in the early stages of the game, such as Cathay, Ogres, Daemons of Chaos, Dark Elves, Vampire Coast and so on.

### Imperial Mandate
The randomised starts and missions that will be introduced in this mod will often bring Karl Franz away from his own territory. To offset the recruitment challenges presented by this, Karl Franz will be given the campaign effect "Imperial Mandate", which represents the idea that Karl Franz as budding leader of the Empire has special access to resources and recruitment that allows him to be effective wherever his business takes him.

The Imperial Mandate provides the following bonuses:
- +20% army replenishment
- -50% recruitment costs
- -2 global recruitment turn time

These bonuses will allow Karl Franz to recruit units and recoup from battle losses as effectively as if he were in his home regions.

### More Elector Count Interactions
More dilemmas and missions to make Fealty and Imperial Authority a more engaging experience.

### Interactions with Loreful Allies
Introduce dilemmas and missions to engage with loreful (but not necessarily lore-accurate) allies of the Empire. Examples including helping Kislev defend against the tides of Chaos, establishing relations with Cathay, and so on.

### XCOM-style Invasions
Invasions with timed objectives will appear throughout Empire regions. It is intended that the player will not be able to resolve all of them especially in the early to mid-game. The player will have to make strategic sacrifices.

Given that Vanilla already has an invasion mechanic featuring Beastmen, Greenskins, Norscans and Skaven, this mod will prioritize other factions (especially Game 3 races) such as Ogres, Daemons of Chaos, Dark Elves, Chaos Dwarves and so on.

### Empire Patrol Officers
A unique lord type with restricted army size but huge upkeep and movement bonuses within Empire territory. They are designed to help defend Empire territory from both new and existing threats.

### Imperial Camp
A limited, Ogre Camp style mechanic designed to provide a sort of base of operations for when certain missions take Karl Franz far away from Empire territory.
